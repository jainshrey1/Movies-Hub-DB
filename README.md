# Movies-Hub-DB
# Application Introduction
Today, movies have evolved into a modern source of entertainment that captivates millions of
audiences worldwide with its breathtaking visuals and unique storylines. With the rise in CGIs
and technology, the need for a movie database has become just as important as well. A movie
database is an organized collection that serves as an accessible resource for accessing
information about movies. The database that we have created allows users to select specific
movies in the database, where the user can then rate the movie(s) based on opinion. Each user
will be able to save their ratings inside their account, where they will be able to register and login
to the system. Finally, users will also be able to visualize important trends and meaningful
insights on the movies based on charts, tables, and graphs created.
Data Sources
The application consists of two main modules: Operational Module and Analytical Module.
Here are the sources that were used:
- Mockaroo - https://www.mockaroo.com/
- Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
- Microsoft Excel
- ERD Plus
- MySQL Workbench
- PyQt Designer
- Python3
  
# Summary of the Operational Module
The user can register and log in to access various modules and functions in the database. Once
the user is logged in, users can search for movies inside the database and be able to retrieve
in-depth information about the movie, such as title, genre, average rating, number of reviews,
and the generated critique for a specific movie. Users can also contribute by selecting reviews
and movies, assigning a rating with a slider, and the option to create a new critique ID. This
system also enables the user to view, edit, and delete the past reviews. The system maintains a
log for users, ensuring the record of critiques and reviews.

# Summary of the Analytical Module
The analytical module is designed to compare and analyze two movies across key metrics. The
Movie Analytical Dashboard allows users to compare between rating, runtime, and revenue
3
which are shown using a bar chart. The database also offers insights into the distribution of the
movies within the genres, with a bar graph. This allows viewers to make decisions about movie
choices based on preferences by previous audiences. Additionally, another bar graph shows the
yearly average rating between genres and would help users understand the popularity of different
movies and time periods. Overall, the database should allow users and influence them to choose
the type of movie to watch based on the visualizations provided.
